Deep binding: value of variables stored in an association list. 
  Simpler to change environment, slower to lookup values.

Shallow binding: value of variables stored in a property field of the variable. 
  Faster to lookup values, higher cost in function calls (need to remember and 
  restore old variable values after each call).

Re-rooting: Technique from Henry Baker to combine deep/shallow binding.
